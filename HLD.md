## ‚öôÔ∏è Non-Functional Requirements

### üîê Security & Privacy
- PCI-aligned handling of financial data.  
- Encryption at rest and in transit (TLS, AES-256).  

### üìà Availability
- Target **99.9% uptime** for core services: authentication, transaction sync, and dashboards.  

### üìä Scalability
- Support user growth from **10k ‚Üí 1M users**.  
- Stateless service architecture with **horizontal scaling**.

### ‚ö° Latency
- Dashboard interactions: **< 300ms** for cached data.  
- Heavier analytics tasks processed asynchronously.

### üìú Compliance & Auditability
- Retain transaction history as per regulatory requirements.  
- Maintain audit logs and track user consent.

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 Frontend (React + Chart.js)
- Responsive web interface for user interaction.  
- Visualizes spending trends, budget progress, and risk metrics using interactive charts.  
- Communicates with backend APIs via HTTPS.  

### 3.2 Backend Services (Django + Django REST Framework)
- Acts as the primary API layer for the frontend.  
- Manages transaction processing, AI budget categorization, and savings recommendations.  
- Integrates with banking APIs to fetch and update transaction data.  

### 3.3 Banking API Integration Layer
- Connects to third-party banking APIs via secure OAuth or token-based authentication.  
- Normalizes transaction data into a consistent internal format.  

### 3.4 AI Budgeting & Risk Analysis Engine
- Categorizes expenses using predefined rules and AI classification models.  
- Generates personalized budget suggestions based on historical spending patterns.  
- Performs risk analysis by evaluating spending-to-income ratios and forecasting potential shortfalls.  

### 3.5 Database Layer (MySQL)
- Stores user profiles, transaction history, categorized budgets, and AI-generated recommendations.  
- Implements encryption at rest for sensitive fields.  

### 3.6 Authentication & Security
- User authentication handled via Firebase Auth.  
- OTP verification for login and sensitive actions.  
- JWT tokens for secure API calls.  
- All data transfers encrypted using TLS.

## 4. Data Flow

**1. User Login**
- User logs in via Firebase Auth with OTP verification.  
- Backend issues a JWT token upon successful authentication.  

**2. Transaction Fetching**
- Frontend requests transaction data via Django APIs.  
- Backend calls third-party banking APIs securely and stores normalized data in MySQL.  

**3. AI Categorization & Recommendations**
- Transaction data sent to the AI engine for categorization and risk assessment.  
- Budget suggestions stored in the recommendation database.  

**4. Dashboard Rendering**
- Frontend fetches processed data from backend APIs.  
- Chart.js visualizes expense breakdowns, savings progress, and forecast trends.  

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
- **Scalability:** Backend services horizontally scalable using container orchestration (Kubernetes/Docker).  
- **Security:** End-to-end encryption, secure API access, and compliance with data privacy standards (e.g., GDPR).  
- **Performance:** API responses under 300ms for typical queries.  
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime target with monitoring and logging.
